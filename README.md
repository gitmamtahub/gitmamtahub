- 👋 Hi, I’m Mamta Khatri, an enthusiast to know and grow with technology
- 👀 I’m interested in ML-AI and Cloud Computing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Gen-AI
- Whether it’s optimizing supply chains, tracking behaviors for autism therapy, or building multilingual, multi-modal chatbots, I dive deep and do the work. I got the curiosity of a researcher, the structure of an engineer, and the hustle of a developer.

🛠️ Tech-wise, hands-on with Python, MongoDB, Streamlit, Hugging Face, and even Docker.
🧠 Learning-wise, go step-by-step, never shy to ask questions, and always aim for mastery.
🧩 Project-wise, mix domains like NLP, ML pipelines, and industrial engineering like a pro.

From science crosswords to multi-agent AI systems — I do it all. 🔥

My vibe? A future-ready problem solver who blends logic, empathy, and ambition into everything that is build.
